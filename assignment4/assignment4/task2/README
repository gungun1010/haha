You will find 4 families of input datasets in the inputs directory. 

Each one has a graph (.gr) file and a sources (.ss) file. You should read in 
the two files. Then you should use Moore's algorithm on the graph for each 
of the sources in the sources file. 

Sample outputs from my serial code are in the outputs directory. You need
not format the outputs as I did, but these files should serve to illustrate
the nature and amount of output required, and they may be helpful in making
certain that your code is producing the proper answers.

In addition, I have provided a sample program that reads the graph and
sources files and sets up the graph adjacency list data structure. You need 
not use my particular data structures---use whatever data structures you
are most comfortable with (though you must use the adjacency list graph
representation because the graphs are so sparse).

One last note: I strongly recommend using small test cases while developing and 
debugging your programs, since they run for a very short time. For looking into performance,
I am sure you'll want to concentrate on the larger cases and the USA-Roads family.

You may be able to investigate scalability using multiple test problems from a single family.
